How to Use the Library Management System

    Add Book: Add a new book to the library by providing the title and author.
    Borrow Book: Borrow a book by providing the title. If the book is available, it will be marked as borrowed.
    Return Book: Return a borrowed book by providing the title. If the book was borrowed, it will be marked as available.
    Display Books: Display all the books in the library along with their status (available or borrowed).
    Exit: Exit the library management system.

This code provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the library. The Library class manages the collection of books and their statuses, while the Book class represents individual books.
