This poker  game allows players to input their actions:
    After the hands are dealt, each player is prompted to choose whether to keep their current hand or discard it and draw new cards.
    After both players have made their decisions, the winner is determined based on the highest card value in each hand.
Running the Game:
    Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., poker_game.py).
